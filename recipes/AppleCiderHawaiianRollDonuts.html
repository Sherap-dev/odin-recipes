    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple Cider Hawaiian Roll Donuts are a cozy twist on a fall favorite, made with soft, pillowy Hawaiian rolls transformed into golden-fried donuts. Each bite bursts with the warm flavors of apple cider, cinnamon, and sugar, perfectly balanced by the rolls’ naturally sweet, buttery taste. Finished with a spiced sugar coating or a drizzle of apple cider glaze, these donuts are light, fluffy, and irresistibly comforting—like autumn in every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-count) package Hawaiian rolls</li>
        <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
        <li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced Apple Cider)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.</li>

</li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet. 

</li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. </li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.  

</li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <li>Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture. </li>
